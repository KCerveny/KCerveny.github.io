## Background

Although a simple, this is one of my favorite projects. It is reliably one of the items most commented on by my friends and family. A large part of this is because both sides of my family actually have roots in Wisconsin, although my parents met on the west coast.

At the University of Wisconsin, there is a spot on lake Mendota called "The Union Terrace", where students have gathered for decades to drink pitchers of beer and eat Babcock ice cream by the water. A lot of my family went to UW Madison, so this place holds a special place for us. I have been going to the union since I was a baby on our annual summer trips back to WI to see family.

On the union terrace, there are these distinctive metal chairs gathered around tables for visitors. If you have ever been to the terrace you will know them. They are _the union chairs_, wholly recognizable and distinct to this place. As such, they have become a defacto symbol for the terrace, and by extension all of the great times and memories had there. I didn't even go to school at Wisconsin and I am sentimental for them. They really are wonderful.

## Design

These were first designed right before I began working at Texas Inventionworks during the summer after my 4th year at UT Austin. I was doing a summer study abroad in Denmark with my girlfriend Barna, and told her that I wanted to make some coasters for my family to celebrate their Wisconsin backgrounds. Her and I devised the sandwich design, with the felt inserts to match the colors of the chairs.

The design was very straightforward. Each coaster would be composed of three layers of 1/8th inch plywood. The bottom layer would be a simple circle. The middle layer would be a ring, with the outer diameter matching that of the top and bottom layers. A hole would be cut in the center to accomodate the colored felt insert. Finally, the top layer would be in the pattern of the union chairs, with holes cut to show the colored felt sandwiched in the middle.

## Fabrication

### Laser Cutting

There was a lot of discovery while I made these coasters. Although I had used the Spectrum lasers before, this was my first project using only vector cuts. For each cut, I could tune the laser on both speed and intensity.

If I ran the laser too quickly, the cuts would be garbled and uneven. If the laser moved too slowly it risked burning the wood too greatly, ruining the finish. To properly perform the cuts, each movement needed to be fast enough to not take hours or burn the piece, but slow enough to not have additional vibrations.

The laser intensity needed to match the speed to cut cleanly through without charring. There is a delicate balance to a good laser cut!

### Assembly

Now that we had all of our parts cut, we moved on to prepping the wood. After the first batch, this became a quite ordered assembly.

- Run some sandpaper over both sides of each piece, making sure to remove any splinters and rough spots.
- Lay out all of the top and bottom sheets on two thick sheets of butcher paper, setting the center rings to the side.
- Stain only the top of the top pieces and bottom of the bottom, so that the sides that would get glued remained unstained. Wait to dry.
- Sand the stained pieces and stain them again.
- Glue the base and middle pieces with wood glue. Gorilla glue the felt into its space in the center. Wait to dry.
- Glue the tops on. Dry again.
- Sand the edges of each costers such that they were smooth.
- Stain the exterior and edge once more, careful to not drip into the felt.
- Glue on felt bottoms. Make sure the colors match.

Really not a complicated process. Mostly relaxing, if you like woodworking.

## Learnings

Some projects we measure by the outcome. Some, we measure by what we learned from them. Even further, some projects are meaningful by the opportunities that they provided later on. To me, this project is all of these.

Naturally, I think these coasters are lovely. The _outcome_ was exactly as grand as I had hoped, and celebrated by the recipients accordingly. And naturally making these coasters increased my competency using a laser cutter as well.

But the reason I felt compelled to do a writeup on this project was because of the confidence it gave me. I wish every would-be creator would try a simple project like this. There is an indescribable quality to the confidence you get when you successfully execute a design. The ability to tell yourself: _I came up with this idea and made it, **and I could do it again**_.

I really cannot stress this enough. **If you, the person reading this right now, have an idea that you have not executed because you have never done anything like it before, you should do it.** Even an easy, simple version of that idea. Cheat if you must, but do it. The confidence, capability, and creativity you will experience has momentum. Build on that, and you will go a startling distance.

This is a favorite project of mine. I love it because of what it represents to those whom I gifted these coasters, as well as what it meant for my trajectory as a creator.

Sometimes, I would even find this design frustrating. Although my design skills and proficiency with the lasers grew with time, it was so challenging to ever clear the bar set by this project. I am still not convinced that I was able to top the simplicity and effectiveness of these coasters.
