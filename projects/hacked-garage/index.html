The garage door was opened with a fairly generic looking opener. Unfortunately for me, I lost mine one day. This was a big problem. How was I going to get back in my garage?</p> <p>My hope was that I could go purchase a replacement and reprogram it to open the door. So I went on Amazon and got myself a 2 pack of the <em>exact</em> same opener that I had just lost.</p> <h2 id="reverse-engineering">Reverse Engineering</h2> <p>So I had an opener. But how was I going to reprogram it? Of course, the first thing I had to do was crack it open to see what was going on inside.</p> <p>On the outside of the remote there was some text that said “FCC ID: SU7318LIPW2KC”. I knew this device was an intentional transmitter, so it would have to registered with the Federal Communications Commission to ensure it would not interfere with other devices. I looked up the device on the <a href="https://fccid.io/SU7318LIPW2KC" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">public database</a> to see if I could find any more information about the board.</p> <p>Sure enough, we got a hit. And there was an astounding amount of information available about the board. The <a href="https://fccid.io/SU7318LIPW2KC/Users-Manual/User-Manual-2103408" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">user manual</a> indicated that the transmitter operated at the ISM band of 318MHz, and also indicated that it used a Weigand 26 bit output. I also checked out the <a href="https://fccid.io/SU7318LIPW2KC/Internal-Photos/Internal-Photos-2103407" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">images of the PCB</a> to ensure that these were the same transmitters.</p> <p>Already this is a lot of information. The reports have told us on which band to listen, and what to expect when we do. The next step is to hear what the transmitter has to say.</p> <h2 id="rf-sniffing">RF Sniffing</h2> <p>Most people are familiar with the idea of tuning a radio to different frequencies to listening to different music stations in their car. But can this be done for other frequencies outside of the normal radio band? Absolutely, but not with a normal radio. I picked up a software-defined radio that could pick up signals from 27MHz-1700MHz, plenty of range to hear the button’s 318MHz signal.</p> <div class="row justify-content-sm-center"> <div class="col-sm-6 mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/projects/electronics/hacked-garage/amazon-sdr-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/projects/electronics/hacked-garage/amazon-sdr-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/projects/electronics/hacked-garage/amazon-sdr-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"></source> <img src="/assets/img/projects/electronics/hacked-garage/amazon-sdr.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" alt="Amazon SDR" title="Amazon SDR" data-zoomable="" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> USB software defined radio, available on Amazon. </div> <p>To make the <strong>software defined radio</strong> (SDR) work, I installed and configured AirSpy SDR#.

If this is true, that would mean that <strong>the key fob is sending the same signal on each press</strong> of the button.

To explain it simply, a replay attack is simply a third party repeating a password that it overheard between two entities talking. If you overhear the secret phrase <em>and it doesn’t change</em>, you should be able to repeat this phrase to the door guard and gain entry as well.</p> <div class="row justify-content-sm-center"> <div class="col-sm-6 mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/projects/electronics/hacked-garage/replay-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/projects/electronics/hacked-garage/replay-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/projects/electronics/hacked-garage/replay-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"></source> <img src="/assets/img/projects/electronics/hacked-garage/replay.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" alt="Replay attack diagram" title="Replay attack diagram" data-zoomable="" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> Diagram of a replay attack. In this diagram we are "Darth", listening to Bob's secrets as he tells them to Alice. </div> <p>By listening in to what the garage door button was saying using our SDR, we can see from the signal that it keeps repeating the garage code on each keypress. This is a sign that the garage at the apartment will be vulnerable to a replay attack. To do this, we will need to overhear the password being communicated.</p> <h3 id="the-weakest-link">The Weakest Link</h3> <p>As a quick aside, I want to underline just how bad this is from a security point of view. Most people will think about their home’s security through their door locks, cameras, alarm and systems and think they are covered. But just how many people think about their garage as a vector of entry? Probably fewer people.</p> <p>However, most personal home garages use a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rolling_code" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">rolling code</a> system, so they are not susceptible to the replay attack. This still does not make them impenetrable. If you leave the door to your house from your garage unlocked, I hope this demonstration will cause you to reconsider.</p> <h3 id="inspecting-the-signal">Inspecting the Signal</h3> <p>Back to the project. From AirSpy, we can see that the code being sent by these garage openers is the same on each press. At this point, we can see that the password repeats, but we cannot yet be sure what it is. In order to decipher the password, we must capture and analyze the signal sent by the opener.</p> <p>In AirSpy, I set the receiver format to RAW to pick up the direct data coming from the opener. After centering on the opener’s band, I pressed record in AirSpy and then pressed the opener’s button a few times. AirSpy converts this recording into a WAV file, which can be opened in music editing software. I chose the prominent tool <a href="https://www.audacityteam.org/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Audacity</a> to inspect the file.</p> <div class="row justify-content-sm-center"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/projects/electronics/hacked-garage/audacity-open-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/projects/electronics/hacked-garage/audacity-open-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/projects/electronics/hacked-garage/audacity-open-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"></source> <img src="/assets/img/projects/electronics/hacked-garage/audacity-open.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" alt="Opening the captured signal in Audacity" title="Opening the captured signal in Audacity" data-zoomable="" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/projects/electronics/hacked-garage/spectrum-analyzer-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/projects/electronics/hacked-garage/spectrum-analyzer-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/projects/electronics/hacked-garage/spectrum-analyzer-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"></source> <img src="/assets/img/projects/electronics/hacked-garage/spectrum-analyzer.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" alt="Getting a better view with the spectrum analyzer" title="Getting a better view with the spectrum analyzer" data-zoomable="" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> Left to Right: Opening the captured signal in Audacity. Adding in the spectrum analyzer. </div> <p>Why open it in an audio editing software? Surely not to listen to it. All information sent over radio waves are some type of wave signal. Sound is also a wave signal. If we can interpret sound waves using Audacity, we should be able to edit any kind of wave, especially since it was so nicely packaged as a sound file.</p> <p>Opening the file in Audacity, we can see a patten emerge. This is a much more clear version of the chunky repeating pattern we saw in AirSpy. In the interface I enabled the spectrum analyzer, set the a wideband window size, and linearly scaled the response. By doing so, I divided the frequency spectrum into eight small bands. This, along with setting the frequency window to between 1-8 kHz completely eliminated higher frequencies in the signal, showing us the pattern more clearly.</p> <div class="row justify-content-sm-center"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/projects/electronics/hacked-garage/one-cycle-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/projects/electronics/hacked-garage/one-cycle-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/projects/electronics/hacked-garage/one-cycle-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"></source> <img src="/assets/img/projects/electronics/hacked-garage/one-cycle.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" alt="A cycle of the garage door's signal" title="A cycle of the garage door's signal" data-zoomable="" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> Zooming in to a single cycle of the garage door's code. </div> <h2 id="decoding-the-secret-message">Decoding the Secret Message</h2> <p>With the spectrogram filters set, we can easily each active pulse is the signal, and can more easily estimate their durations. Counting the blue spikes, there were 24 pulses transmitted. Isolating a single iteration of the code, we can see the full duration takes approximately 0.14 seconds to complete.</p> <p>Recall from the FCC filing that the transmitter uses the Weigand 26 bit protocol. If we look up a chart of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiegand_interface" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Weigand protocol</a>, we see that the first and last of the 26 bits sent are both parity bits, containing no data about the code. Since the code is bits (binary digits), we must determine the orders of the 24 1’s and 0’s in the code. As we repeatedly observed 24 pulses in our code, we can assume that this implementation does not include the leading and trailing parity bits.</p> <p>Looking further into the FCC documentation, the included test report mentions that the devices use a “modified <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_code" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Manchester encoded modulation</a>”. In our case, the modulation of the signal defines what is considered a one or a zero. The protocol defines what those ones and zeroes mean.</p> <div class="row justify-content-sm-center"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/projects/electronics/hacked-garage/Manchester-coding.webp-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/projects/electronics/hacked-garage/Manchester-coding.webp-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/projects/electronics/hacked-garage/Manchester-coding.webp-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"></source> <img src="/assets/img/projects/electronics/hacked-garage/Manchester-coding.webp" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" alt="Manchester encoding diagram" title="Manchester encoding diagram" data-zoomable="" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/projects/electronics/hacked-garage/weigand-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/projects/electronics/hacked-garage/weigand-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/projects/electronics/hacked-garage/weigand-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"></source> <img src="/assets/img/projects/electronics/hacked-garage/weigand.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" alt="Weigand data protocol" title="Weigand data protocol" data-zoomable="" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> Left to right: Manchester encoding diagram.

To do that, we will need to modify the hardware.</p> <div class="row justify-content-sm-center"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/projects/electronics/hacked-garage/frontside-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/projects/electronics/hacked-garage/frontside-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/projects/electronics/hacked-garage/frontside-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"></source> <img src="/assets/img/projects/electronics/hacked-garage/frontside.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" title="Button PCB Front" data-zoomable="" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/projects/electronics/hacked-garage/backside-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/projects/electronics/hacked-garage/backside-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/projects/electronics/hacked-garage/backside-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"></source> <img src="/assets/img/projects/electronics/hacked-garage/backside.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" title="Button PCB Back" data-zoomable="" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> Left to right: Garage door opener PCB frontside.

Although my device worked according to plan, I never needed to use it. Turned out, my apartment was happy to replace my fob for less than the cost of the Amazon SDR. Go figure.</p> <p>All was not lost. I learned so much about RF, the ISM bands, FCC filings, and different means of signal modulation by creating my replacement fob. Reverse-engineering is an excellent way to learn about an unfamiliar system if you have the patience for it. The clunky perfboard setup also necessitated my first need to create a custom PCB, which I would teach myself in a <a href="/projects/follow-me-lights/">project</a> later that summer.</p> <p>This project also opened my eyes to just how <em>vulnerable</em> so many homes and businesses are to the most basic hacking attacks. To this very day I can look at most garage fobs and know if it is easily susceptible to a similar attack as demonstrated above. When you find your keys again, double-check to see if your garage button looks like any of the images below. If it does, I would recommend you lock the door going into your garage when you leave your home. They may be hackable.</p> <div class="row justify-content-sm-center"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/projects/electronics/hacked-garage/sketchy1-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/projects/electronics/hacked-garage/sketchy1-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/projects/electronics/hacked-garage/sketchy1-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"></source> <img src="/assets/img/projects/electronics/hacked-garage/sketchy1.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" title="Possibly vulnerable garage button" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/projects/electronics/hacked-garage/sketchy2-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/projects/electronics/hacked-garage/sketchy2-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/projects/electronics/hacked-garage/sketchy2-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"></source> <img src="/assets/img/projects/electronics/hacked-garage/sketchy2.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" title="Possibly vulnerable garage button" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/projects/electronics/hacked-garage/sketchy-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/projects/electronics/hacked-garage/sketchy-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/projects/electronics/hacked-garage/sketchy-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"></source> <img src="/assets/img/projects/electronics/hacked-garage/sketchy.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" title="Possibly vulnerable garage button" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> Buttons like these and many others may be vulnerable to a replay attack. </div> </article> </div> </div> <div class="col-sm-3"> <nav id="toc-sidebar" class="sticky-top"></nav> </div> </div> </div> <footer class="fixed-bottom" role="contentinfo"> <div class="container mt-0"> © Copyright 2024 Kellan J.
