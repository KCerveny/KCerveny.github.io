## Welcome!

Howdy, partner! Thanks for clickin' on through to my website.

I have some exciting things to share with you. Click on [projects](/projects/) to see some of the cool things I have created. You can check out my [resume](/cv/) page to learn about my professional work. If, for some reason, you cared what I think about miscellaneous topics you can chance my [blog](/blog/), updated whenever I remember I have a blog.

## About Me

I am a creator. Not really a content creator, just a _stuff_ creator. I am very objective oriented, so wether its writing software, developing hardware, designing tools, or writing love letters, I am all in. My favorite feeling is when the skills I have learned in a previous project stack into new capabilities for my next venture.

I am also naturally entrepreneurial. The most exciting things don't even exist yet, and I relish in trying to be a part of making them happen. Visit my [projects](/projects/) page to see some of the things I have been able to create.

When I am not creating or learning, you will probably find me outside. Any chance I get I try to be running, hiking, or kayaking Ladybird Lake here in Austin. Whenever I get the chance I am with my girlfriend Barna and her cat Junebug. If I don't respond to your message I am at Chuy's on Barton Springs.
